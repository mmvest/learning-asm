## What is this?
Learn assembly with me! I will slowly be learning and accruing resources and projects related to assembly and storing them here. Maybe one day this can become a completely self-guided course of sorts.

For now, I am going to be focusing on x64 assembly using the Microsoft x64 ABI (Application Binary Interface). As such, I plan on starting with MASM (Microsoft Macro Assembler) as my assembler to stick with Microsof products. To that end, I do hope to one day expand out to NASM and/or FASM. I also hope to expand into x86 assembly and to also learn the Linux System V ABI.

If I continue to stick with this project or if this gains some speed, I will update the readme to be a bit more in-depth and explanatory. For now, get an assembler and the development environment of your choice, sit down, and make some assembly!

## Resources
I will be adding resources here as I go!
